# MineGame

Very simple minefield game. You start at square A1 and must get to H8 without hitting the mines.
There are currently 20 mines and 3 player lives hardcoded.

If I had more time available I'd expand the unit test coverage, sure up some areas of logic for better error handling, and add options for the game to configured by the player.
